2D_Solver_Test
==============

### EM Solver in 2D, in testing...
Requires numpy, matplotlib


### Change Log


* 30/10/2019 added stuff

### TODO

* Add epsilon and mu matrices
* Change matrix algebra method

### Questions

* When adding Gaussian source to H field, do we immediately
use update equations on E_x and E_y using this value?

* Should we try to normalise our values? How to choose a Gaussian
such that we have good values to look at?

* How to test whether our update equations are working well?

* How does the vector/matrix addition work in Matlab?
